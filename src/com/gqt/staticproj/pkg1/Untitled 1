Static Segment contains 3 important members:
	--> static variables
	--> static blocks
	--> static methods

all the static members will be associated with the static keyword

The features of static members is:
--> static member will be prioritized over other members
--> they get executed even before the object execution
--> we need not create the object to execute the static members
--> static members can be directly accessed using the class name
--> memory for the static variables will be created only once
--> the static variables will be the instance variables with static reference
--> No matter how many objects we create static variables will be created only
    once for every program
--> the execution of the program does not start from main method rather it will
	actually be executed from the static segment.
--> main method will also execute from the static segment only
--> the order of execution is :
	1. static variables
	2. static blocks
	3. main method (static method)
--> Once the static variables are created they will be allocated with default
	values
--> Inside a class we will also contains non-static members 
	--> non-static variables
	--> non-static blocks
	--> non-static methods
--> Non-static methods and Non-static blocks can access the static variables
--> static methods and static blocks cannot access the non-static variables
--> Non-static block will be executed when the object is created
