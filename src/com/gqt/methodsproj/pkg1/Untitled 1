Method Overloading:
	Method Overloading refers to the process of creating multiple methods with same name, 
	same numbers of parameters but the order of the parameters will be different.
	In method overloading nothing is getting overloaded it is just the illusion that one method 
	is doing multiple tasks but in reality every method is independent and it performs the 
	tasks uniquely.
