Strings in java are used for representing the series of characters.
Strings in java are the built-in class which is present inside the package 
named as "java.lang"
Strings in java do not end with the null character
Strings in java are classified into 2 types:
1. Mutable Strings
		Strings that can be altered once created.
		It is represented using StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes
		
2. Immutable Strings
		Strings that cannot be altered once created.
		It is represented using String class.
		
Different ways to created immutable strings:
1. Using Literal
	The memory for the literal based representation will be created in
	the constant pool of the String Pool in the Heap Segment.
	In constant pool the duplication of the data is not permitted rather 
	the existing data will be utilized.
	
2. Using object
	The memory for the object based representation will be created in
	the non-constant pool of the String Pool in the Heap Segment
	In non-constant pool the duplication of the data is permitted.
	
Different ways to compare the Strings
1. using equals() to compare the contents of the string
2. using == to compare the addresses
3. using equalsIgnore() to compare the contents of the string
4. using compareTo() to compare the contents of the string
