Conventional Approach:
int a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z;

Array Approach:
--> Arrays in java are treated as objects.
--> Arrays in java will start from 0th position

Advantages:
1. Creation of the array is simple
	int arr[] = new int[5];
	
2. Storing the data inside an array is simple
	arr[0] = 25;
	arr[1] = 21;
	
3. Fetching the data from the array is simple
